This is my first solo project showcasing my knowledge in learning SQL query syntax. 

*Dataset was taken from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/komal1111/online-bookstore-analysis)
*Dataset Covers sales trends, customer behavior, and book genre preferences
*Data was cleaned & aggregated before quering 
*Example query: Find Books published after the year 1950
select * from Books
where Published_Year > 1950;
